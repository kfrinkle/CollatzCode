# CollatzCode
This is where all code related to the Collatz Conjecture will be located

There are three main programs here which are the three versions of the Collatz Code found in the article `Computing Streaks of Consecutive Numbers with the Same Collatz Height'.

CollatzMPIOneStreakCheckV4b.cpp -- the original Collatz streak computing code, no bells and whistles.  This is Version 1
FastestOne.cpp -- the modified code that introduces lookup tables and other shortcuts.  This is Version 2
LinearArrayExtra2DCleanBB.cp -- even more modified to increase performance.  This is Version 3
