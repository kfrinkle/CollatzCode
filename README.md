# CollatzCode
This is where all code related to the Collatz Conjecture will be located


CollatzMPIOneStreakCheckV4b.cpp -- the original Collatz streak computing code, no bells and whistles.

FastestOne.cpp -- the modified code that introduces lookup tables and other shortcuts.

LinearArrayExtra2DCleanBB.cp -- even more modified to increase performance.
